# âœ… [Completed]  Hello World Part 4 Tutorial

This project contains the COMPLETED files for [Alchemy's Hello World Part 4](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/creating-a-full-stack-dapp), in which we teach you how to create a full stack dApp by connecting your Hello World smart contract to a React frontend using Metamask and Web3 tools.

# ðŸªœ Installation
To use this dApp, you'll need to do the following:

1. Run `npm install` to download the `node_modules` folder.
2. Download the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) in your project directory by running `npm install dotenv --save` in your terminal
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory this `nft-minter` by entering the following on your command line: `vim .env` and then add your [Alchemy API Key](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/creating-a-full-stack-dapp#establish-an-api-connection-to-the-ethereum-chain). Altogether, your `.env` file should just look like so:

```
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_KEY = wss://eth-ropsten.ws.alchemyapi.io/v2/<key>
```
4. Run `npm start`in your terminal to open the dApp in your browswer at http://localhost:3000/.
